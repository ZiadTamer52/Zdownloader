## Quick Download (Windows)

Download the latest **standalone .exe** — no Python installation required!

→ Go to [**Releases** → Latest version](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Zdownloader/releases/latest)  
→ Click on `Zdownloader.exe` (or `Zdownloader_vX.Y.Z.exe`) under **Assets**  
→ Run it directly

Antivirus note: Some AVs flag brand-new unsigned .exe files → you may need to click "More info → Run anyway". This is common for self-built tools.

- Real-time progress + speed + ETA
- Video thumbnail preview (after "Get Info")
- Modern look powered by **ttkbootstrap** (dark themes)
- Custom save folder (defaults to `Downloads/YouTube Downloads`)
- Clean log console
- Ctrl+V paste + Enter to download
- Opens folder automatically when done
- Threaded → GUI stays responsive
